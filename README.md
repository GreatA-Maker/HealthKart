  So it was a great experience to us while building this task we have learnt so many new concepts and how to apply tech-tools whatever we have learnt in our current unit. The project covers basic front end designs up to a certain level and showcasing basic functionality like signup, signin, product viewing, adding it to cart then finally placing order by filling address details and making successful payment. I greatly thankful to my instructor *Swanand Kadam* and also instructor associate *Kamal* for guiding us which helpled me to feel confident and work upon the project and to complete within the specified time period.
