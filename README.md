### **HealthKart Website Clone Project**

This is our second Construct Week Project at Masai School's Full Stack Web Development Course. We are currently at the end of third unit where we need to make projects as per mastery based progression environment of _Masai School_ after learnig certain tech-tools and in third unit we have learnt APIs and cloning of some of apps like Youtube, Weather Forecasting App, MovieSearch App, Google Map, Ecommerce app and ES6, debouncing technique, Authentication and Validation, Constructor Functions, Asynchronous Programming, Prototype Inheritance, , import and export calls, Promises , Road to backend by using which we need to create website clones. So the motto of this project is to create *HealthKart* website clone, which provides an online platform to buy nutritional products, health products, protein supplements, ayurvedic products etc at a good price with a variety of types and prices. 

  So it was a great experience to us while building this task we have learnt so many new concepts and how to apply tech-tools whatever we have learnt in our current unit. The project covers basic front end designs up to a certain level and showcasing basic functionality like signup, signin, product viewing, adding it to cart then finally placing order by filling address details and making successful payment. I greatly thankful to my instructor *Swanand Kadam* and also instructor associate *Kamal* for guiding us which helpled me to feel confident and work upon the project and to complete within the specified time period.
